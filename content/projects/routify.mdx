![Routify Example](/routify/Routify.gif)

[Routify](https://www.routify.cc) is a pathfinding visualizer built to work with any city listed on OpenStreetMap. It was built to discover how pathfinding algorithms work in a completely different way.

This project focuses on the showcase of pathfinding algorithms like Breadth-First-Search (BFS), Depth-First-Search (DFS), and A* Search.

The main complexities of learning such algorithms is the understanding in its recursive logic. Many students struggle to visually understand the meaning of recursive traversal through node-based graphs.

[Routify](https://www.routify.cc) is the solution to this problem in a fun, interactive way.

## Features

- You can search for any city listed on OpenStreetMap, a open-source mapping service similar to Google Maps

![Search A City](/routify/searching_city.gif)

- You can place starting and ending points accurately on the map

- You can choose any algorithm to try

- You can measure the speed of different algorithms

- You can customize the canvas to your liking

## Tech Stack

The driving force of [Routify](https://www.routify.cc) is ThreeJS, a powerful WebGL-based library that can render 3D objects in the browser.

## Challenges

## Inspirations

Pathfinding visualizers is not necessarily a new concept, there have been other projects that display pathfinding.

Some examples include,

- [Python Rendered Visual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgW0HPHqFE8&pp=ygUWcGF0aGZpbmRpbmcgdmlzdWFsaXplcg%3D%3D)
- [Ex-Googler Clement's Pathfinding Visualizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak&t=2855s&pp=ygUWcGF0aGZpbmRpbmcgdmlzdWFsaXplcg%3D%3D)
- [Grid-based Pathfinding Visualizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9REexHx0hDY&pp=ygUWcGF0aGZpbmRpbmcgdmlzdWFsaXplcg%3D%3D)
- [Visualizing Pathfinding Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W8hNdEUFbc&ab_channel=CodeNoodles)

These are great projects in their own ways, but this project's advantage is that you can see the direct applications of the algorithms by running them on real-world cities.

## Conclusion

This was an awesome project to learn about pathfinding, web development, and 3D rendering.

The code is [open-source](https://www.routify.cc) and you are more than welcome to check it out! If you have any suggestions, advice, or heck, even thoughts on this project. Feel free to comment below!
